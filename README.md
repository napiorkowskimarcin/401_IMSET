# HOMEWORK IMSET

## Task is to re-create a .psd template with full freedom to choose technology stack

## Used:

- NodeJS/ Express (do not know React enough to use it for the exercise like this, so I selected that technology stack to render HBS templates. The biggest advantage is that I can use as much partials as I want- that is a way simpler and cleaner way of creating views for me)
- Handlebars to create views (didn`t use EJS, no need of complex JS on site). Layout: main, partials for most of the elements (header, footer, rows)
- Bootstrap 4.5 - Usually I use materialize, but that one is more popular and I have a chance to refresh it.
- GIMP to clear images elements that I wanted to recreate with CSS/ Bootstrap as I do not have Photoshop. Anyway, I did`t use it for at least 7 years. Plus I have Linux/Mint for programming stuff. It was a chance to install and learn it.
- Font awesome - I did`t find some of the icons to match exacttly the template - the worst one is android icon. Do apologise for it.
- Google fonts - I did`t find a font to match perfectly yours, but I checked with filter 'narrow' and I looks preety good.

### Note: I faced some problems with PSD layouts - I did not have time to sort it out, so I cut page by myself. I am sure you have prepared it well, and the issue is GIMP.
